Difference between Document & Window objects

Window
  
   > The Window object is the top level object in JavaScript, and contains in itself several other objects, such as "document", "history" etc.
   >The window object represents an open window in a browser.
   >If a document contain frames (<iframe> tags), the browser creates one window object for the HTML document, and one additional window object for each frame.
   
Document

  >When an HTML document is loaded into a web browser, it becomes a document object.
  >The document object is the root node of the HTML document and the "owner" of all other nodes :( element nodes, text nodes, attribute nodes, and comment nodes).
  >The document object provides properties and methods to access all node objects, from within JavaScript.
